<p>Black altered some of the songs from the original album and worked with Lloyd Webber on new material: "The Last Man in My Life", "I Love New York" and "Married Man", the latter set to the same tune as "Sheldon Bloom". A new orchestration of the Variations for a sixteen-piece theatre orchestra was produced from the original symphonic version played by the <ref target="/wiki/London_Philharmonic_Orchestra" title="London Philharmonic Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</ref> but <ref target="/wiki/Harry_Rabinowitz" title="Harry Rabinowitz">Harry Rabinowitz</ref> retained the baton for the stage production. "When You Want to Fall in Love", with a tune previously released by Marti Webb and <ref target="/wiki/Justin_Hayward" title="Justin Hayward">Justin Hayward</ref> as "Unexpected Song" which itself was later added to the score, was used at the climax of the dance section to meld the two halves.<ref target="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</ref></p>

<h2>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Song_and_Dance&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Reviewing the London production, the <ref target="/wiki/Financial_Times" title="Financial Times">Financial Times</ref> theatre critic Michael Coveney claimed, "It is a long time since I have sat through a more ostentatious, less theatrically coherent evening."</p>
<p>In <ref target="/wiki/Frank_Rich" title="Frank Rich">Frank Rich</ref>'s New York Times review of the Broadway production, he wrote: "Miss Peters is more than talented: As an actress, singer, comedienne and all-around warming presence, she has no peer in the musical theater right now. In her half of Song & Dance, she works so hard you'd think she were pleading for mercy before a firing squad. Yet for all the vocal virtuosity, tempestuous fits and husky-toned charm she brings to her one-woman musical marathon, we never care if her character lives or dies.."<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/John_Simon_(critic)" title="John Simon (critic)">John Simon</ref>, in The New York Magazine, noted that the unseen men seemed "nebulous and unreal, so too, does the seen woman", and in the Dance half, "things go from bad to worse." However, he wrote that "Miss Peters is an unimpeachable peach of a performer who does so much for the top half of this double bill as to warrant its immediate rechristening 'Song of Bernadette'. She not only sings, acts, and (in the bottom half) dances to perfection, she also, superlatively, 'is' ".<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref>
