<h2>Plot synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=A_Catered_Affair&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Plot synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bronx" title="Bronx">Bronx</ref> in 1953, young lovers Jane Hurley and Ralph Halloran decide to get married. Meanwhile Jane's father, Tom, who owns a third-share in a taxi, agrees with one of his partners, Sam, that they will buy out the share of the third driver, Pasternak. Jane and Ralph, along with Tom and Sam, happily exclaim the virtues of partnership ("Partners"). Timing is inauspicious, since the bride's brother has just been killed in the <ref target="/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</ref>. The couple does not want a large, expensive wedding, and Tom needs the money to buy out Pasternak. As Jane's mother Aggie announces that the upcoming wedding will be held quickly and quietly in City Hall, the neighborhood women react ("Women Chatter"). Dinner with Ralph's wealthier family leads Aggie to decide to give the couple a huge formal affair, committing her and Tom's life's savings and bereavement check to an elaborate wedding with an extensive guest list and a lavish catered reception ("Our Only Daughter"). Aggie feels guilty about having neglected Jane and sees an opportunity to plan the <ref target="/wiki/White_wedding" title="White wedding">white wedding</ref> that she herself never had. The bride's gay Uncle Winston, initially hurt and furious at having been left off the original guest list, becomes a support for Aggie.</p>
<p>Jane is initially beguiled by the attention, and happily picks out a wedding dress ("One White Dress"). But soon relationships are strained to the breaking point under the pressure of costly bridesmaids' dresses, cake layers, and each detail. Aggie confesses to Jane that she and Tom were married because she was pregnant ("Vision"), and because her father bought Tom his share in the taxi. Finally Jane and Ralph decide to call off the elaborate wedding and party and marry quietly as they had planned. The quiet and unemotional Tom finally expresses his love and caring for Aggie ("I Stayed"), and Tom and Aggie come closer together. As they get ready for the small wedding ceremony, Aggie secretly makes arrangements for Tom to buy his share of the taxi, which arrives in time for him to drive her to their daughter's wedding. Uncle Winston has the last word ("Coney Island"):</p>

 "You paid your money, took the ride, but missed the view."

<h2>Critical response[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=A_Catered_Affair&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Critical response">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>A Catered Affair received mixed reviews.<ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<ref target="/wiki/Ben_Brantley" title="Ben Brantley">Ben Brantley</ref> for <ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref>, wrote: "From Mr. Bucchino’s trickling, self-effacing score to the tight-lipped stoicism of its leading performances, from David Gallo’s tidy tenement-scape set to Zachary Borovay’s tentative photographic projections, this show is all pale, tasteful understatement that seems to be apologizing for asking for your attention... Ms. Prince, best known for her madcap musical turns in revivals of Guys and Dolls and Bells Are Ringing, scrubs down to raw-skinned plainness here. Her performance is tight, disciplined and at times quite affecting, never more so than when Aggie looks silently at some distant horizon of missed opportunities."<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref>
<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clive_Barnes_(critic)" title="Clive Barnes (critic)">Clive Barnes</ref>, reviewing for the <ref target="/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</ref>, wrote: "Under John Doyle's expert, discreet direction, it emerges less like a musical and more like a play with music: lovely, urban chamber music. But you won't come out humming the tunes, or even the scenery. You'll come out humming the characters."<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref>
<p>But <ref class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=Linda_Winer&action=edit&redlink=1" title="Linda Winer (page does not exist)">Linda Winer</ref>, for <ref target="/wiki/Newsday" title="Newsday">Newsday</ref>, wrote: "How bold to make a Broadway musical on such restrained material as A Catered Affair. How sad that the results are so glum. Despite the dedication of a fine cast...this is a colorless little piece of '50s social realism about a Bronx family that isn't so much emotionally repressed as emotionally deficient." She panned the "meandering, conversational melodies ba[c]ked by innocuous accompaniments", and the "tasteful but bland production", and concluded: "Winston, who wants the big wedding, observes, 'Resigning oneself to small is sad. Requesting it is tragic.' He could be talking about the show."<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
