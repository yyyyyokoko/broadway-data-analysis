<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Grapes_of_Wrath&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The narrative begins just after Tom Joad is paroled from <ref target="/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Penitentiary" title="Oklahoma State Penitentiary">McAlester prison</ref>, where he had been imprisoned after being convicted of <ref target="/wiki/Homicide" title="Homicide">homicide</ref>. While hitchhiking to his home near <ref target="/wiki/Sallisaw,_Oklahoma" title="Sallisaw, Oklahoma">Sallisaw, Oklahoma</ref>, Tom meets former preacher Jim Casy, whom he remembers from his childhood, and the two travel together. When they arrive at Tom's childhood farm home, they find it deserted. Disconcerted and confused, Tom and Casy meet their old neighbor, Muley Graves, who tells them the family has gone to stay at Uncle John Joad's home nearby. Graves tells them that the banks have evicted all the farmers, but he refuses to leave the area.</p>
<p>The next morning, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's. Tom finds his family loading their remaining possessions into a <ref target="/wiki/Hudson_Motor_Car_Company" title="Hudson Motor Car Company">Hudson</ref> sedan converted into a truck; with their crops destroyed by the <ref target="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" title="Dust Bowl">Dust Bowl</ref>, the family has defaulted on their bank loans, and their farm has been repossessed. The family sees no option but to seek work in California, which has been described in handbills as fruitful and offering high pay. The Joads put everything they have into making the journey. Although leaving Oklahoma would violate his parole, Tom decides it is worth the risk, and invites Casy to join him and his family.</p>
<p>Traveling west on <ref target="/wiki/U.S._Route_66" title="U.S. Route 66">Route 66</ref>, the Joad family finds the road crowded with other migrants. In makeshift camps, they hear many stories from others, some returning from California, and the group worries that California may not actually be as promising as it seems. The family dwindles as well: Grandpa dies along the road, and they bury him in a field; Grandma dies close to the California state line; and both Noah (the eldest Joad son) and Connie Rivers (the husband of the pregnant Joad daughter, Rose of Sharon) leave the family. Led by Ma, the remaining members realize they can only continue, as nothing is left for them in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Reaching California, they find the state <ref target="/wiki/Reserve_army_of_labour" title="Reserve army of labour">oversupplied with labor</ref>; wages are low, and workers are exploited to the point of starvation. The big corporate farmers are in collusion and smaller farmers suffer from collapsing prices. <ref target="/wiki/Weedpatch_Camp" title="Weedpatch Camp">Weedpatch Camp</ref>, one of the clean, utility-supplied camps operated by the <ref target="/wiki/Resettlement_Administration" title="Resettlement Administration">Resettlement Administration</ref>, a <ref target="/wiki/New_Deal" title="New Deal">New Deal</ref> agency, offers better conditions but does not have enough resources to care for all the needy families. Nonetheless, as a Federal facility, the camp protects the migrants from harassment by local deputies.</p>



<p>“</p>

<p>How can you frighten a man whose hunger is not only in his own cramped stomach but in the wretched bellies of his children? You can't scare him – he has known a fear beyond every other.</p>

<p>”</p>


<p>—  Chapter 19</p>

<p>In response to the <ref target="/wiki/Exploitation_of_labour" title="Exploitation of labour">exploitation</ref>, Casy becomes a labor organizer and tries to recruit for a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Labor_union" title="Labor union">labor union</ref>. The remaining Joads find work as <ref target="/wiki/Strikebreaker" title="Strikebreaker">strikebreakers</ref> in a peach orchard, where Casy is involved in a strike that eventually turns violent. When Tom witnesses Casy's fatal beating, he kills the attacker and flees as a fugitive. The Joads quietly leave the orchard to work at a cotton farm, where Tom remains at risk of being arrested for the homicide.</p>
<p>Knowing he must leave the area or risk being caught and his family blacklisted from working, Tom bids his mother farewell and vows to work for the oppressed. The rest of the family continues to pick cotton and pool their daily wages so they can buy food. Rose of Sharon's baby is stillborn. Ma Joad remains steadfast and forces the family through the bereavement. With the winter rains, the Joads' dwelling is flooded and the car disabled, and they move to higher ground. In the final chapter of the book, the family takes shelter from the flood in an old barn. Inside they find a young boy and his father, who is dying of <ref target="/wiki/Starvation" title="Starvation">starvation</ref>. Rose of Sharon takes pity on the man and offers him her breast milk to save him from starvation.</p>

<h2>Religious interpretation[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Grapes_of_Wrath&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Religious interpretation">edit</ref>]</h2>

(April 2017)
<p>Many scholars have noted Steinbeck's use of Christian imagery within The Grapes of Wrath. The largest implications lie with Tom Joad and Jim Casy, who are both interpreted as Christ-like figures at certain intervals within the novel. These two are often interpreted together, with Casy representing Jesus Christ in the early days of his ministry, up until his death, which is interpreted as representing the death of Christ. From there, Tom takes over, rising in Casy's place as the Christ figure risen from the dead.</p>
<p>However, the religious imagery is not limited to these two characters. Scholars have regularly inspected other characters and plot points within the novel, including Ma Joad, Rose of Sharon, Rose of Sharon's stillborn child, and Uncle John. In an article first published in 2009, Ken Eckert even compared the migrants' movement west as a reversed version of the slaves' escape from Egypt in <ref target="/wiki/Book_of_Exodus" title="Book of Exodus">Exodus</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref> Many of these extreme interpretations are brought on by Steinbeck's own documented beliefs, which Eckert himself refers to as "unorthodox".<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref></p>

<p>Steinbeck was known to have borrowed from field notes taken during 1938 by <ref target="/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration" title="Farm Security Administration">Farm Security Administration</ref> worker and author <ref target="/wiki/Sanora_Babb" title="Sanora Babb">Sanora Babb</ref>. While Babb collected personal stories about the lives of the displaced migrants for a novel she was developing, her supervisor, Tom Collins, shared her reports with Steinbeck, who at the time was working for the San Francisco News.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref> Babb's own novel, Whose Names Are Unknown, was eclipsed in 1939 by the success of The Grapes of Wrath and was shelved until it was finally published in 2004, a year before Babb's death.</p>
<p>The Grapes of Wrath developed from <ref target="/wiki/The_Harvest_Gypsies" title="The Harvest Gypsies">The Harvest Gypsies</ref>, a series of seven articles that ran in the San Francisco News, from October 5 to 12, 1936. The newspaper commissioned that work on migrant workers from the Midwest in California's agriculture industry. (It was later compiled and published separately.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-cordyack-12">[12]</ref>)</p>

<p>While writing the novel at his home, 16250 Greenwood Lane, in what is now <ref target="/wiki/Monte_Sereno,_California" title="Monte Sereno, California">Monte Sereno, California</ref>, Steinbeck had unusual difficulty devising a title. The Grapes of Wrath, suggested by his wife Carol Steinbeck,<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> was deemed more suitable than anything by the author. The title is a reference to lyrics from "<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic" title="The Battle Hymn of the Republic">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</ref>", by <ref target="/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe" title="Julia Ward Howe">Julia Ward Howe</ref> (emphasis added):</p>


<p>Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:</p>
<p>He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;</p>
<p>He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword:</p>
<p>His truth is marching on.</p>



<p>These lyrics refer, in turn, to the biblical passage <ref target="/wiki/Book_of_Revelation" title="Book of Revelation">Revelation</ref> 14:19–20, an apocalyptic appeal to divine justice and deliverance from oppression in the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Final_judgment" title="Final judgment">final judgment</ref>. This and other biblical passages had inspired a long tradition of imagery of <ref target="/wiki/Christ_in_the_winepress" title="Christ in the winepress">Christ in the winepress</ref>, in various media. The passage reads:</p>

<p>And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>

<p>The phrase also appears at the end of chapter 25 in Steinbeck's book, which describes the purposeful destruction of food to keep the price high:</p>

<p>[A]nd in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.</p>

<p>The image invoked by the title serves as a crucial symbol in the development of both the plot and the novel's greater thematic concerns: from the terrible winepress of <ref target="/wiki/Dust_Bowl" title="Dust Bowl">Dust Bowl</ref> oppression will come terrible wrath but also the deliverance of workers through their cooperation. This is suggested but not realized within the novel.</p>

<h2>Author's note[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Grapes_of_Wrath&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Author's note">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>When preparing to write the novel, Steinbeck wrote: "I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this [the Great Depression and its effects]." He famously said, "I've done my damnedest to rip a reader's nerves to rags." His work won a large following among the working class, due to his sympathy for the migrants and workers' movement, and his accessible prose style.<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>

<h2>Critical reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Grapes_of_Wrath&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Critical reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Steinbeck scholar John Timmerman sums up the book's influence: "The Grapes of Wrath may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel – in criticism, reviews, and college classrooms – of 20th century American literature."<ref target="#cite_note-cordyack-12">[12]</ref> The Grapes of Wrath is referred to as a <ref target="/wiki/Great_American_Novel" title="Great American Novel">Great American Novel</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-15">[15]</ref></p>
<p>At the time of publication, Steinbeck's novel "was a phenomenon on the scale of a national event.

<p>The book was noted for Steinbeck's passionate depiction of the plight of the poor, and many of his contemporaries attacked his social and political views. Bryan Cordyack wrote: "Steinbeck was attacked as a propagandist and a <ref target="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialist</ref> from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The most fervent of these attacks came from the Associated Farmers of California; they were displeased with the book's depiction of California farmers' attitudes and conduct toward the migrants.

<h2>Hints of plagiarism[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Grapes_of_Wrath&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Hints of plagiarism">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Following the publication of Sanora Babb's Whose Names Are Unknown in 2004, some scholars noted strong parallels between that work—the notes for which Steinbeck is widely believed to have examined<ref target="#cite_note-KenBurns-23">[23]</ref>—and The Grapes of Wrath.</p>
<p>Writing in The Steinbeck Review, Michael J. Meyer noted numerous "obvious similarities" between the two novels "that even a cursory reading will reveal," such as Babb's account of two still-born babies, mirrored in Steinbeck's description of Rosasharn's baby. Among other scenes and themes repeated in both books: the villainy of banks, corporations, and company stores that charge exorbitant prices; the rejection of religion and the embrace of music as a means of preserving hope; descriptions of the fecundity of nature and agriculture, and the contrast with the impoverishment of the migrants; and the disparity between those willing to extend assistance to the migrants and others who view "Okies" as subhuman.<ref target="#cite_note-24">[24]</ref> Meyer, a Steinbeck bibliographer, stops short of labeling these parallels as plagiarism but concludes that "Steinbeck scholars would do well to read Babb—if only to see for themselves the echoes of Grapes that abound in her prose."</p>
<p>Steinbeck scholar David M. Wrobel wrote that "the John Steinbeck-Sanora Babb story sounds like a classic smash-and-grab: celebrated California author steals the material of unknown Oklahoma writer, resulting in his financial success and her failure to get her work published. ... Steinbeck absorbed field information from many sources, primarily Tom Collins and Eric H. Thomsen, regional director of the federal migrant camp program in California, who accompanied Steinbeck on missions of mercy. ... If Steinbeck read Babb’s extensive notes as carefully as he did the reports of Collins, he would certainly have found them useful. His interaction with Collins and Thomsen—and their influence on the writing of The Grapes of Wrath—is documented because Steinbeck acknowledged both. Sanora Babb went unmentioned."<ref target="#cite_note-25">[25]</ref></p>
<p>Writing in Broad Street magazine, Carla Dominguez described Babb as "devastated and bitter" that Random House canceled publication of her own novel after The Grapes of Wrath was released in 1939. It is clear, she wrote, that "Babb’s retellings, interactions, and reflections were secretly read over and appropriated by Steinbeck. Babb met Steinbeck briefly and by chance at a lunch counter, but she never thought that he had been reading her notes because he did not mention it." When Babb's novel was finally published in 2004, she declared that she was a better writer than Steinbeck. “His book,” Babb said, “is not as realistic as mine.”<ref target="#cite_note-26">[26]</ref></p>

By the time she was ready to publish her work, in the winter of 1939, Steinbeck had come out with his own Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Grapes of Wrath. Steinbeck's book was dedicated to Tom Collins and was an immediate best-seller—such a hit, New York editors told Babb, that the market could not bear another on the same subject.

Discusses the visual style of John Ford's cinematic adaptation of the novel. Usually the movie is examined in terms of its literary roots or its social protest. But the imagery of the film reveals the important theme of the Joad family's coherence. The movie shows the family in closeups, cramped in small spaces on a cluttered screen, isolated from the land and their surroundings. Dim lighting helps abstract the Joad family from the reality of Dust Bowl migrants. The film's emotional and aesthetic power comes from its generalized quality attained through this visual style.</p>
