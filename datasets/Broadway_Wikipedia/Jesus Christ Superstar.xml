<p>Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 <ref target="/wiki/Rock_opera" title="Rock opera">rock opera</ref> with music by <ref target="/wiki/Andrew_Lloyd_Webber" title="Andrew Lloyd Webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</ref> and lyrics by <ref target="/wiki/Tim_Rice" title="Tim Rice">Tim Rice</ref>. The musical started as a rock opera <ref target="/wiki/Jesus_Christ_Superstar_(album)" title="Jesus Christ Superstar (album)">concept album</ref> before its <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> debut in 1971. The musical is mostly <ref target="/wiki/Sung-through" title="Sung-through">sung-through</ref>, with little spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the <ref target="/wiki/Life_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament" title="Life of Jesus in the New Testament">Gospels' accounts</ref> of the last week of <ref target="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</ref>'s life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his <ref target="/wiki/Apostle" title="Apostle">disciples</ref> in Jerusalem and ending with the <ref target="/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">crucifixion</ref>. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between <ref target="/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</ref> and Jesus that are not present in the <ref target="/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</ref>.</p>
<p>The work's depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centers on Judas, who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples.</p>
<p>Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock-opera's lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional <ref target="/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</ref>.</p>

<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Jesus_Christ_Superstar&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<ref target="/wiki/Judas_Iscariot" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</ref>, a member of the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/12_apostles" title="12 apostles">Twelve Apostles</ref>, voices concern over <ref target="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</ref>'s rising popularity and the negative repercussions that it will have, criticizing Jesus for accepting his followers' unrealistic beliefs ("Heaven on Their Minds"). While Judas loves Jesus, he believes that he is just a man, not God, and worries that his following will be seen as a threat to the <ref target="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</ref>, which would severely punish Jesus, his associates, and possibly all Jewish people. Judas's warning goes unheeded, as Jesus's followers have their minds set on going to <ref target="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</ref> with Jesus. When they ask Jesus for information about his plans for the future, Jesus refuses to give them any, since whatever will happen is determined by God ("What's the Buzz").
<p>Recognizing that Jesus is irritated by the badgering and lack of understanding from his followers, <ref target="/wiki/Mary_Magdalene" title="Mary Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</ref> tries to help Jesus relax. Judas does not like how it looks, though he does not object to her being a prostitute. It seems to Judas that Jesus is contradicting his own teaching, and he worries that this apparent lack of judgment will be used against Jesus and his followers ("Strange Thing Mystifying"). Jesus tells Judas that Mary is with him now, and unless Judas is without <ref target="/wiki/Sin" title="Sin">sin</ref> he should not judge the character of others. Jesus then reproaches the rest of the apostles and bitterly complains that not a single one of them truly cares if he comes or goes. Mary Magdalene tries to reassure Jesus while <ref target="/wiki/Anointing_of_Jesus" title="Anointing of Jesus">anointing him with oil</ref> ("<ref target="/wiki/Everything%27s_Alright_(Jesus_Christ_Superstar_song)" title="Everything's Alright (Jesus Christ Superstar song)">Everything's Alright</ref>"). Judas angrily insists that the money spent on oil could have been used to help the poor. Sadly, Jesus answers that they simply do not have the resources to end poverty, and that they should be glad for what comforts they have, including himself; therefore, he warns Judas that he will be sorry when Jesus is gone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <ref target="/wiki/Caiaphas" title="Caiaphas">Caiaphas</ref>, the <ref target="/wiki/High_Priest_of_Israel" title="High Priest of Israel">High Priest of Israel</ref>, assembles the <ref target="/wiki/Pharisees" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</ref> together at the <ref target="/wiki/Sanhedrin" title="Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</ref> to talk about Jesus and his disciples. According to the Pharisees, Jesus's growing following consists of Jews unwilling to accept the Romans as their rulers, and the priests believe that Jesus may come to be seen as a threat to the Roman Empire, and to the priesthood's integrity; if the Romans retaliate, many Jews will suffer, even those who are not following Jesus. Caiaphas then concludes that there could be great bloodshed and suggests that they kill him for the greater good, and the Pharisees concur upon his decision ("<ref target="/wiki/This_Jesus_Must_Die" title="This Jesus Must Die">This Jesus Must Die</ref>"). As Jesus and his followers <ref target="/wiki/Triumphal_entry_into_Jerusalem" title="Triumphal entry into Jerusalem">arrive exultantly in Jerusalem</ref>, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus should postpone the parade, which Jesus says would be futile and change nothing, and he proceeds to greet the happy <ref target="/wiki/Israelites" title="Israelites">Israelites</ref> instead ("Hosanna"). As the crowd cheers him on, they suddenly ask Jesus if he would die for them. To this, Jesus visibly reacts with concern. Then, one of his apostles, <ref target="/wiki/Simon_the_Zealot" title="Simon the Zealot">Simon the Zealot</ref>, suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power ("Simon Zealotes"). Jesus rejects this suggestion, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is, nor do they understand his true message ("Poor Jerusalem").</p>
<ref target="/wiki/Pontius_Pilate" title="Pontius Pilate">Pontius Pilate</ref>, the governor of Judea, has a dream in which he meets with a <ref target="/wiki/Galilean" title="Galilean">Galilean</ref> (in the form of Jesus) and then receives all of the blame for the man's violent and mournful death, predicting the rise of <ref target="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</ref> ("Pilate's Dream"). Jesus arrives at the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_Temple_of_Jerusalem" title="Second Temple of Jerusalem">Temple</ref> in Jerusalem and finds that it has become a haven of sin and debauchery as it is being used for selling everything from <ref target="/wiki/Usury" title="Usury">usury</ref> and weapons to prostitutes and drugs; angered by this, Jesus <ref target="/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple" title="Cleansing of the Temple">drives everyone out</ref> ("The Temple"). A group of <ref target="/wiki/Leprosy" title="Leprosy">lepers</ref> begin to chime up to Jesus for healing. Even though he heals some, their number increases, and he is overwhelmed. Unable to solve everyone's problems, Jesus screams at them to heal themselves until he finds Mary Magdalene by his side, laying him to rest ("Everything's Alright (Reprise)"). While Jesus is asleep, Mary acknowledges that she is unconditionally in love with him, unlike any man she has known before, and it frightens her ("<ref target="/wiki/I_Don%27t_Know_How_to_Love_Him" title="I Don't Know How to Love Him">I Don't Know How to Love Him</ref>").
<p>Conflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and promises to help them arrest Jesus, believing that he is acting with unselfish motives and that Jesus himself would approve if he knew those motives ("Damned for All Time"). Sustaining his testimony, Caiaphas and <ref target="/wiki/Annas" title="Annas">Annas</ref> ask that Judas reveal the location of Jesus so that the authorities can apprehend him. In exchange for the information, Judas is offered <ref target="/wiki/Thirty_pieces_of_silver" title="Thirty pieces of silver">thirty pieces of silver</ref> as a fee so that he can assuage his conscience by using the money charitably ("Blood Money"). Judas decides that it would be better to turn Jesus in before his popularity leads to the deaths of him and his followers, Judas included. He reveals that on Thursday night, Jesus will be at the Garden of <ref target="/wiki/Gethsemane" title="Gethsemane">Gethsemane</ref>.</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Jesus_Christ_Superstar&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>At what Jesus knows will be the <ref target="/wiki/Last_Supper" title="Last Supper">Last Supper</ref>, he pours wine and passes bread for his apostles ("The Last Supper"). Very aware of the ordeal he faces, he is stung when the others pay little attention to him; he remarks that the wine might as well be his blood and the bread his body, then immediately confirms that it is so, alluding to (and anticipating) the Christian doctrine of the <ref target="/wiki/Eucharist" title="Eucharist">Eucharist</ref>. He asks them to remember him when they eat and drink; he predicts that <ref target="/wiki/Saint_Peter" title="Saint Peter">Peter</ref> will <ref target="/wiki/Denial_of_Peter" title="Denial of Peter">deny him three times</ref> in just a few hours and that one of them will betray him. Judas, believing that Jesus already knows, admits that he is the one and angrily accuses Jesus of acting recklessly and egotistically. Claiming he does not understand Jesus's decisions, he leaves to bring the Roman soldiers.</p>
<p>The remaining apostles fall asleep, and Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray ("Gethsemane"). He admits to God his doubts, fears, and anger; that he is tired and has done all he can. He asks if any of it has meaning and implores God not let him suffer the horrible death that portends for him. He feels disillusioned with his quest as the Messiah, does not understand what it has achieved, and wishes to give up. Receiving no answer, Jesus realises that he cannot defy God's will, and surrenders to God. His prayer ends with a request that God take him immediately, before he changes his mind.</p>
<p>Finally, Judas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by <ref target="/wiki/Kiss_of_Judas" title="Kiss of Judas">kissing him on the cheek</ref> ("The Arrest"). While Jesus is <ref target="/wiki/Arrest_of_Jesus" title="Arrest of Jesus">being arrested</ref>, his apostles attempt to fight the soldiers, but Jesus tells them to let the soldiers take him to Caiaphas. On the way, a mob (acting like—and sometimes represented as—modern-day news reporters) asks Jesus what he plans to do, but Jesus declines to comment. When Jesus is <ref target="/wiki/Sanhedrin_trial_of_Jesus" title="Sanhedrin trial of Jesus">brought to trial before the Sanhedrin</ref>, Caiaphas demands to know if he is the King of the Jews, and Jesus responds that that's what they say he is. This answer is affirmative according to Jewish custom, and that provides enough justification for the Pharisees to bring Jesus to Pilate. Meanwhile, Jesus's apostle Peter is confronted by an old man, a soldier and a maid, and Peter denies to each that he knows Jesus ("Peter's Denial"). Mary asks Peter why he denied Jesus, and Peter responds that he had to do it in order to save himself. Mary wonders how Jesus knew that Peter would deny him three times.</p>
<p>Later, Pilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus gives the same answer that he gave Caiaphas. Since Jesus is from <ref target="/wiki/Galilee" title="Galilee">Galilee</ref>, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to <ref target="/wiki/Herod_Antipas" title="Herod Antipas">King Herod</ref> ("Pilate and Christ"). As Jesus is dragged away, the chorus asks where Jesus's power has gone. The decadent and flamboyant King Herod attempts to persuade Jesus into proving his divinity by performing miracles, offering to free him if he complies ("King Herod's Song (Try It And See)"), but Jesus ignores him. Herod decides that Jesus is just another <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/False_messiah" title="False messiah">phony messiah</ref> and angrily sends him back to Pilate. Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of peace ("Could We Start Again, Please?").<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>Later, Judas is horrified upon beholding Jesus's harsh treatment by the authorities. Wracked with guilt, Judas expresses regret to the pharisees, fearing that he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Caiaphas and Annas assure him that what he has done now will save everyone and that he should not feel remorse for his actions. Judas recognizes that God chose him to be the one to betray Jesus, and that he has been used as a pawn. He throws the money on the temple floor in disgust, storms out, collapses on the floor and laments that he still wants to love Jesus, but does not know how("I Don't Know How to Love Him(reprise)"). He curses God for manipulating him, and in a final attempt to detach himself from his destiny, he commits suicide by hanging himself from a tree ("Judas's Death").</p>
<p>At Jesus's trial, Pilate interrogates Jesus into revealing the whereabouts of his kingdom, but is cut off by a bloodthirsty mob which demands that Jesus should be <ref target="/wiki/Capital_punishment" title="Capital punishment">sentenced to death</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/Crucifixion" title="Crucifixion">crucifixion</ref>. In spite of the mob's behavior,<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref> Pilate remembers the dream that he had about the mob and the unjust execution of Jesus. He tells the mob that, while Jesus should be imprisoned, he does not deserve to die. Pilate demands that the crowd give him a reason to condemn Jesus, and the mob answers that Jesus is a <ref target="/wiki/Blasphemy" title="Blasphemy">blasphemer</ref> and has defied the Roman Empire. However, after revealing Jesus as nothing more than a pathetic human being, Pilate calls the crowd hypocrites, as he knows they hate Roman rule. Even so, he decides to satisfy their bloodlust by having Jesus <ref target="/wiki/Flagellation_of_Christ" title="Flagellation of Christ">flogged</ref>, counting thirty-nine bloody strokes ("Trial Before Pilate (Including The Thirty-Nine Lashes)"). Pilate, clearly disturbed by the whole ordeal, pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined by God, and Pilate cannot change it. Even more outraged by Jesus's words, the crowd still calls for Jesus's death, informing Pilate that he has his duty to keep the peace. Finally, he reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus to keep the crowd from getting violent, calling Jesus a self-destructive martyr before changing his mind and seeing him as an innocent puppet.</p>
<p>As Jesus's crucifixion awaits, he is haunted by the ghost of Judas, who taunts him and questions why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if what happened to him was really part of a divine plan, but Judas's questions go unanswered ("<ref target="/wiki/Superstar_(Jesus_Christ_Superstar_song)" title="Superstar (Jesus Christ Superstar song)">Superstar</ref>"). After reciting his <ref target="/wiki/Sayings_of_Jesus_on_the_cross" title="Sayings of Jesus on the cross">final words and commending his spirit to God</ref>, Jesus slowly <ref target="/wiki/Crucifixion_of_Jesus" title="Crucifixion of Jesus">dies on the cross</ref> ("The Crucifixion"). In the end, the Apostles and Mary, mourning the death of their fallen saviour, reflect on the impact he has had on their lives ("John Nineteen: Forty-One").</p>

<p>At the same time, some <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jews</ref> claimed that it bolstered the <ref target="/wiki/Antisemitism" title="Antisemitism">antisemitic</ref> belief that the Jews were responsible for Jesus' death by showing most of the villains as Jewish (<ref target="/wiki/Caiaphas" title="Caiaphas">Caiaphas</ref> and the other priests, Herod) and showing the crowd in Jerusalem calling for the crucifixion.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref> The musical was banned in South Africa for being "<ref target="/wiki/Irreligion" title="Irreligion">irreligious</ref>".<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref> A 1972 production of the play was banned in the <ref target="/wiki/Hungarian_People%27s_Republic" title="Hungarian People's Republic">Hungarian People's Republic</ref> for "distribution of religious propaganda".<ref target="#cite_note-14">[14]</ref></p>
