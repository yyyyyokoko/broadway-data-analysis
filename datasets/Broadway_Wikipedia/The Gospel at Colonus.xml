<p>The Gospel at Colonus premiered at the <ref target="/wiki/Brooklyn_Academy_of_Music" title="Brooklyn Academy of Music">Brooklyn Academy of Music</ref>'s Next Wave Festival in November to December 1983.<ref target="#cite_note-mel-1">[1]</ref></p>
<p>The following year it received a production at the <ref target="/wiki/Arena_Stage" title="Arena Stage">Arena Stage</ref> in Washington D.C. running from Nov 23, 1984 – Dec 30, 1984<ref target="#cite_note-2">[2]</ref></p>
<p>The musical ran at the American Music Theater Festival, Philadelphia, in September 1985.<ref target="#cite_note-times1-3">[3]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>A production at the Alliance Theatre, Atlanta Ga, in 1987 included Morgan Freeman and the Blind Boys of Alabama.<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-6">[6]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-7">[7]</ref></p>
<p>The Gospel at Colonus opened on <ref target="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</ref> at the <ref target="/wiki/Lunt-Fontanne_Theatre" title="Lunt-Fontanne Theatre">Lunt-Fontanne Theatre</ref> on March 11, 1988 in previews, officially on March 14, 1988, and closed on May 15, 1988 after 61 performances and 15 previews. Directed by Lee Breuer, the cast featured <ref target="/wiki/Morgan_Freeman" title="Morgan Freeman">Morgan Freeman</ref> (Messenger), Sam Butler, Jr. (The Singer), Clarence Fountain and the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Five_Blind_Boys_of_Alabama" title="Five Blind Boys of Alabama">Five Blind Boys of Alabama</ref> (Oedipus) and the Institutional Radio Choir of Brooklyn. Breuer was nominated for the 1988 <ref target="/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</ref> for his book.<ref target="#cite_note-8">[8]</ref></p>
<p>The musical was a finalist for the 1985 <ref target="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Drama" title="Pulitzer Prize for Drama">Pulitzer Prize for Drama</ref>.<ref target="#cite_note-9">[9]</ref> The musical won the 1984 <ref target="/wiki/Obie_Award" title="Obie Award">Obie Award</ref> as Best Musical.<ref target="#cite_note-10">[10]</ref></p>
<p>The production was the centerpiece of the outdoor Freefest in 1995 at the People's Light and Theatre Co. in Malvern, Pa. 20,000 people composed a half white, half non-white audience attending for free as part of director Danny Fruchter's Iliad Project, a multi-year performance research exploration, expanding modern performance forms by including cross cultural and ancient modes. 90 singers, largely from the churches of the racially mixed industrial town of Coatesville, Pa. performed in a suburban Philadelphia theater drawing the largest, most racially and geographically diverse audience in that theater's history.</p>
<p>The musical was produced at the Apollo Theater, New York City, in October 2004, featuring <ref target="/wiki/Charles_S._Dutton" title="Charles S. Dutton">Charles S. Dutton</ref> as the Preacher, the Blind Boys of Alabama and the Legendary Soul Stirrers.<ref target="#cite_note-11">[11]</ref></p>
<p>The production at the Nate Holden Performing Arts Center, Los Angeles, by the Ebony Repertory Theatre was nominated for the 2015 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards for theatrical excellence.<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref><ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref></p>
<p>In May, 2018, director Danny Fruchter and most of the original cast of the 1995 People's Light production, will reprise Gospel at Colonus for the first time in an actual church setting, rather than a theater, at the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia, one of the earliest anti-slavery congregations in that city (www.colonusinphilly.org). In the 19th century the Pastor and congregation opposed the Fugitive Slave Act, and later, eulogized John Brown when his body passed through town. In the 20th century the Church hosted Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi. With Bishop Bruce Parham as Oedipus, and major Philadelphia Gospel singers Audrey Mickell, Marilyn Brewington, and Paula and Charlene Holloway.</p>

<h2>Overview[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Gospel_at_Colonus&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Breuer and Telson handed the storytelling duties to a black <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pentecostal" title="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</ref> preacher and the choir of his church, who in turn enacted the story of Oedipus's torment and redemption as a modern <ref target="/wiki/Parable" title="Parable">parable</ref>. They employed the unusual device of casting <ref target="/wiki/The_Blind_Boys_of_Alabama" title="The Blind Boys of Alabama">The Blind Boys of Alabama</ref> to collectively portray Oedipus as well as the <ref target="/wiki/Institutional_Radio_Choir" title="Institutional Radio Choir">Institutional Radio Choir</ref> in Brooklyn and Chancel Choir of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Other casting innovations in the performance include multiple actors in single roles, such as when The Messenger is called upon to assume the role of Oedipus in tandem with the singer cast when the role calls for stage motion that would be difficult for the blind singer to negotiate alone, the multiplicity of Oedipus's daughters and one son when the children of Oedipus appear collectively (with Jevetta Steele as Ismene, her sister Jearlyn Steele doubling for actress Isabell O'Connor as Antigone, and brothers J.D. and Fred Steele standing in as Polynices and Eteocles, with actor Kevin Davis doubling as Polynices), and, indeed, with different portions of the cast, singly and in groups, assuming the duties of the traditional Greek chorus.</p>
<ref target="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</ref>'s Mel Gussow has expressed the view that the result was the translation of the Greek myth into a Christian parable. In his review of the BAM production, Gussow noted: "It is surprising how organically "Oedipus" can fit within the framework of a gospel musical... the evening has the shape of a church service."<ref target="#cite_note-mel-1">[1]</ref>
<p>While the traditions of Greek theater as religious ritual are unfamiliar to modern audiences, Gospel at Colonus reaffirms those possibilities by its use of call-and-response and ecstatic, sung re-enactment of a culturally important story.</p>

<h2>Television and film[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Gospel_at_Colonus&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Television and film">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In 1985 <ref target="/wiki/PBS" title="PBS">PBS</ref> televised the original <ref target="/wiki/Brooklyn_Academy_of_Music" title="Brooklyn Academy of Music">Brooklyn Academy of Music</ref> production, as presented by the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/American_Music_Theater_Festival" title="American Music Theater Festival">American Music Theater Festival</ref> at the Annenberg Center in Philadelphia, as part of the <ref target="/wiki/Great_Performances" title="Great Performances">Great Performances</ref> series. The performers included <ref target="/wiki/Morgan_Freeman" title="Morgan Freeman">Morgan Freeman</ref> as The Messenger, <ref target="/wiki/Carl_Lumbly" title="Carl Lumbly">Carl Lumbly</ref> as Theseus, <ref target="/wiki/Jevetta_Steele" title="Jevetta Steele">Jevetta Steele</ref> as <ref target="/wiki/Ismene" title="Ismene">Ismene</ref>, and <ref target="/wiki/Robert_Earl_Jones" title="Robert Earl Jones">Robert Earl Jones</ref> as Creon. In the 1985 incarnation, <ref target="/wiki/The_Soul_Stirrers" title="The Soul Stirrers">The Soul Stirrers</ref> (credited collectively) and the <ref target="/wiki/Institutional_Radio_Choir" title="Institutional Radio Choir">Institutional Radio Choir</ref> assume roles as citizens of Colonus.<ref target="#cite_note-times1-3">[3]</ref> In 1995 WHYY/Philadelphia aired a one hour special, The Peoples Gospel at Colonus, highlighting Director Danny Fruchter's thought that Greek Theatre and the African American Church reflect ideas about community essential to both cultures. This community involvement, in fact the chorus making the story, was central to his 1995 production at the People's Light and Theatre Co. during the 3rd Annual FreeFest, in which all tickets were free and most performers were part of the same town of nearby Coatesville, PA.</p>
<p>The first-act song "How Shall I See You Through My Tears?" was used as the opening number of the 2003 film, <ref target="/wiki/Camp_(2003_film)" title="Camp (2003 film)">Camp</ref>.</p>
