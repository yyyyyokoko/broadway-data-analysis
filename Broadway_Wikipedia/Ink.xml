<p>Ink is a <ref target="/wiki/Liquid" title="Liquid">liquid</ref> or paste that contains <ref target="/wiki/Pigment" title="Pigment">pigments</ref> or <ref target="/wiki/Dye" title="Dye">dyes</ref> and is used to color a surface to produce an <ref target="/wiki/Image" title="Image">image</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Writing" title="Writing">text</ref>, or <ref target="/wiki/Design" title="Design">design</ref>.

<p>Ink can be a complex medium, composed of <ref target="/wiki/Solvent" title="Solvent">solvents</ref>, pigments, dyes, <ref target="/wiki/Resin" title="Resin">resins</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Lubricant" title="Lubricant">lubricants</ref>, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Solubilizer" title="Solubilizer">solubilizers</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Surfactant" title="Surfactant">surfactants</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Suspended_solids" title="Suspended solids">particulate matter</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Fluorescence" title="Fluorescence">fluorescents</ref>, and other materials. The components of inks serve many purposes; the ink's carrier, colorants, and other additives affect the flow and thickness of the ink and its dry appearance.</p>
<p>In 2011 worldwide consumption of printing inks generated revenues of more than 20 billion US dollars. Demand by traditional print media is shrinking, on the other hand more and more printing inks are consumed for packagings.<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>

<p>In <ref target="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Rome</ref>, <ref target="/wiki/Atramentum" title="Atramentum">atramentum</ref> was used; in an article for the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Christian_Science_Monitor" title="Christian Science Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</ref>, Sharon J. Huntington describes these other historical inks:</p>

<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Oak_galls_and_iron(II)_sulfate_-_California_State_Archives.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Oak_galls_and_iron(II)_sulfate_-_California_State_Archives.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Oak galls and iron(II) sulfate .
<p>About 1,600 years ago, a popular ink recipe was created. The recipe was used for centuries. Iron salts, such as ferrous sulfate (made by treating iron with sulfuric acid), were mixed with tannin from <ref target="/wiki/Gall" title="Gall">gallnuts</ref> (they grow on trees) and a thickener. When first put to paper, this ink is bluish-black. Over time it fades to a dull brown.</p>
<p>Scribes in <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Medieval" title="Medieval">medieval</ref> <ref target="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</ref> (about AD 800 to 1500) wrote principally on <ref target="/wiki/Parchment" title="Parchment">parchment</ref> or <ref target="/wiki/Vellum" title="Vellum">vellum</ref>. One 12th century ink recipe called for hawthorn branches to be cut in the spring and left to dry. Then the bark was pounded from the branches and soaked in water for eight days. The water was boiled until it thickened and turned black. Wine was added during boiling. The ink was poured into special bags and hung in the sun. Once dried, the mixture was mixed with wine and iron salt over a fire to make the final ink.<ref target="#cite_note-15">[15]</ref></p>
<p>The reservoir pen, which may have been the first <ref target="/wiki/Fountain_pen" title="Fountain pen">fountain pen</ref>, dates back to 953, when <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Al_Muizz" title="Al Muizz">Ma'ād al-Mu'izz</ref>, the <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caliph" title="Caliph">caliph</ref> of <ref target="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</ref>, demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir.<ref target="#cite_note-16">[16]</ref></p>
<p>In the 15th century, a new type of ink had to be developed in Europe for the <ref target="/wiki/Printing_press" title="Printing press">printing press</ref> by <ref target="/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg" title="Johannes Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</ref>. According to Martyn Lyons in his book Books: A Living History, Gutenberg's dye was indelible, oil-based, and made from the soot of lamps (lamp-black) mixed with varnish and egg white.<ref target="#cite_note-17">[17]</ref> Two types of ink were prevalent at the time: the Greek and Roman writing ink (soot, glue, and water) and the 12th century variety composed of ferrous sulfate, gall, gum, and water.<ref target="#cite_note-18">[18]</ref> Neither of these handwriting inks could adhere to printing surfaces without creating blurs. Eventually an oily, <ref target="/wiki/Varnish" title="Varnish">varnish</ref>-like ink made of soot, <ref target="/wiki/Turpentine" title="Turpentine">turpentine</ref>, and walnut oil was created specifically for the printing press.</p>

<p>Ink formulas vary, but commonly involve two components:</p>

<p>Colorants</p>
<p>Vehicles (binders)</p>
<p>Inks generally fall into four classes:<ref target="#cite_note-kipphan130-144-19">[19]</ref></p>

<p>Aqueous</p>
<p>Liquid</p>
<p>Paste</p>
<p>Powder</p>
<h3>Colorants[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Ink&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Colorants">edit</ref>]</h3>
<h4>Pigments[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Ink&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Pigments">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Main article: <ref target="/wiki/Pigment" title="Pigment">Pigment</ref></p>
<p>Pigment inks are used more frequently than dyes because they are more color-fast, but they are also more expensive, less consistent in color, and have less of a <ref target="/wiki/Gamut" title="Gamut">color range</ref> than dyes.<ref target="#cite_note-kipphan130-144-19">[19]</ref></p>
<p>Pigments are solid, opaque particles suspended in ink to provide color.<ref target="#cite_note-kipphan130-144-19">[19]</ref> Pigment molecules typically link together in <ref target="/wiki/Crystal" title="Crystal">crystalline</ref> structures that are 0.1–2 <ref target="/wiki/Micrometre" title="Micrometre">µm</ref> in size and comprise 5–30 percent of the ink volume.<ref target="#cite_note-kipphan130-144-19">[19]</ref> Qualities such as <ref target="/wiki/Hue" title="Hue">hue</ref>, <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saturation_(color_theory)" title="Saturation (color theory)">saturation</ref>, and <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lightness_(color)" title="Lightness (color)">lightness</ref> vary depending on the source and type of pigment.</p>

<h4>Dyes[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Ink&action=edit&section=5" title="Edit section: Dyes">edit</ref>]</h4>
<p>Main article: <ref target="/wiki/Dye" title="Dye">Dye</ref>Dye-based inks are generally much stronger than pigment-based inks and can produce much more color of a given density per unit of mass. However, because dyes are dissolved in the liquid phase, they have a tendency to soak into paper, potentially allowing the ink to bleed at the edges of an image.</p>
<p>To circumvent this problem, dye-based inks are made with solvents that dry rapidly or are used with quick-drying methods of printing, such as blowing hot air on the fresh print. Other methods include harder paper <ref target="/wiki/Sizing" title="Sizing">sizing</ref> and more specialized paper coatings. The latter is particularly suited to inks used in non-industrial settings (which must conform to tighter toxicity and emission controls), such as <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inkjet_printer" title="Inkjet printer">inkjet printer</ref> inks. Another technique involves coating the paper with a charged coating. If the dye has the opposite charge, it is attracted to and retained by this coating, while the solvent soaks into the paper. <ref target="/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">Cellulose</ref>, the wood-derived material most paper is made of, is naturally charged, and so a compound that complexes with both the dye and the paper's surface aids retention at the surface. Such a compound is commonly used in ink-jet printing inks.</p>
<p>An additional advantage of dye-based ink systems is that the dye <ref target="/wiki/Molecule" title="Molecule">molecules</ref> can interact with other ink ingredients, potentially allowing greater benefit as compared to pigmented inks from <ref target="/wiki/Optical_brightener" title="Optical brightener">optical brighteners</ref> and color-enhancing agents designed to increase the intensity and appearance of dyes.</p>
<p>A more recent development in dye-based inks are dyes that react with cellulose to permanently color the paper. Such inks are not affected by water, alcohol, and other solvents.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>] As such, their use is recommended to prevent frauds that involve removing signatures, such as <ref target="/wiki/Check_washing" title="Check washing">check washing</ref>. This kind of ink is most commonly found in gel inks and in certain <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fountain_pen_inks" title="Fountain pen inks">fountain pen inks</ref>.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>

<p>There is a misconception that ink is non-toxic even if swallowed. Once ingested, ink can be hazardous to one's health. Certain inks, such as those used in digital printers, and even those found in a common pen can be harmful. Though ink does not easily cause death, repeated skin contact or ingestion can cause effects such as severe headaches, skin irritation, or nervous system damage.<ref target="#cite_note-20">[20]</ref> These effects can be caused by solvents, or by pigment ingredients such as <ref target="/wiki/P-Anisidine" title="P-Anisidine">p-Anisidine</ref>, which helps create some inks' color and shine.</p>
<p>Three main environmental issues with ink are:</p>

<p>Ink uses up non-renewable oils and metals, which has a negative impact on the environment.<ref target="#cite_note-22">[22]</ref></p>

<h3>Carbon[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Ink&action=edit&section=7" title="Edit section: Carbon">edit</ref>]</h3>
<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Inkstick.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Inkstick.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Chinese <ref target="/wiki/Inkstick" title="Inkstick">inkstick</ref>; carbon-based and made from <ref target="/wiki/Soot" title="Soot">soot</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Animal_glue" title="Animal glue">animal glue</ref>.
<p>Carbon inks were commonly made from lampblack or soot and a binding agent such as <ref target="/wiki/Gum_arabic" title="Gum arabic">gum arabic</ref> or <ref target="/wiki/Animal_glue" title="Animal glue">animal glue</ref>. The binding agent keeps carbon particles in suspension and adhered to paper. Carbon particles do not fade over time even when bleached or when in sunlight. One benefit is that carbon ink does not harm paper. Over time, the ink is chemically stable and therefore does not threaten the paper's strength. Despite these benefits, carbon ink is not ideal for permanence and ease of preservation. Carbon ink tends to smudge in humid environments and can be washed off surfaces. The best method of preserving a document written in carbon ink is to store it in a dry environment (Barrow 1972).</p>
<p>Recently, carbon inks made from carbon nanotubes have been successfully created. They are similar in composition to traditional inks in that they use a polymer to suspend the carbon nanotubes. These inks can be used in inkjet printers and produce electrically conductive patterns.<ref target="#cite_note-23">[23]</ref></p>

<h3>Iron gall (common ink)[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Ink&action=edit&section=8" title="Edit section: Iron gall (common ink)">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Main article: <ref target="/wiki/Iron_gall_ink" title="Iron gall ink">Iron gall ink</ref></p>
<p>Iron gall inks became prominent in the early 12th century; they were used for centuries and were widely thought to be the best type of ink. However, iron gall ink is corrosive and damages paper over time (Waters 1940). Items containing this ink can become brittle and the writing fades to brown. The original scores of <ref target="/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</ref> are threatened by the destructive properties of iron gall ink. The majority of his works are held by the German State Library, and about 25% of those are in advanced stages of decay (American Libraries 2000). The rate at which the writing fades is based on several factors, such as proportions of ink ingredients, amount deposited on the paper, and paper composition (Barrow 1972:16). Corrosion is caused by acid catalysed hydrolysis and iron(II)-catalysed oxidation of cellulose (Rouchon-Quillet 2004:389).</p>
<p>Treatment is a controversial subject. No treatment undoes damage already caused by acidic ink. Deterioration can only be stopped or slowed. Some[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch">who?</ref>] think it best not to treat the item at all for fear of the consequences. Others believe that non-aqueous procedures are the best solution. Yet others think an aqueous procedure may preserve items written with iron gall ink. Aqueous treatments include distilled water at different temperatures, calcium hydroxide, calcium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium bicarbonate, and calcium phytate. There are many possible side effects from these treatments. There can be mechanical damage, which further weakens the paper. Paper color or ink color may change, and ink may bleed. Other consequences of aqueous treatment are a change of ink texture or formation of plaque on the surface of the ink (Reibland & de Groot 1999).</p>
<p>Iron gall inks require storage in a stable environment, because fluctuating <ref target="/wiki/Relative_humidity" title="Relative humidity">relative humidity</ref> increases the rate that formic acid, acetic acid, and furan derivatives form in the material the ink was used on. Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst to cellulose hydrolysis, and iron (II) sulfate acts as a catalyst to cellulose oxidation.

<p>Indelible means "unremovable".

<p>The Election Commission in India has used indelible ink for many elections. Indonesia used it in its last election in <ref target="/wiki/Aceh" title="Aceh">Aceh</ref>. In <ref target="/wiki/Mali" title="Mali">Mali</ref>, the ink is applied to the fingernail.
