<h2>Background in history[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mountaintop&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Background in history">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>Further information: <ref target="/wiki/Assassination_of_Martin_Luther_King_Jr." title="Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.">Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.</ref></p>
<p>In 1968, <ref target="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr." title="Martin Luther King Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</ref> was in <ref target="/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</ref> to speak out on the behalf of the <ref target="/wiki/Memphis_sanitation_strike" title="Memphis sanitation strike">Memphis sanitation workers</ref> who went on strike regarding the death of two workers crushed by a malfunctioning truck. The workers dealt with continuous mistreatment and denial of their civil rights. A week before his assassination, King led a demonstration through downtown Memphis which resulted in the death of one reporter as well as a multitude of injuries and property damages. The poor work conditions and pay the sanitation workers suffered angered the black community and encouraged them to speak out on the behalf of other issues concerning civil rights.</p>
<p>Martin Luther King Jr. on April 3, the night before his assassination, gave his speech, <ref target="/wiki/I%27ve_Been_to_the_Mountaintop" title="I've Been to the Mountaintop">I've Been to the Mountaintop</ref>, where he declared, "We've got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end. Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis. We've got to see it through."<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref> King was nothing but supportive, even saying that he did not want to leave Memphis until his work was done. King along with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference produced the idea of the <ref target="/wiki/Poor_People%27s_Campaign" title="Poor People's Campaign">Poor People's Campaign</ref>, a campaign that demanded economic and human rights for poor Americans of diverse backgrounds. Before he could finalize his ideas and plans however, he was assassinated on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis on April 4. King was rushed to <ref target="/wiki/St._Joseph%27s_Hospital_(Memphis,_Tennessee)" title="St. Joseph's Hospital (Memphis, Tennessee)">St. Joseph's Hospital</ref> for surgery and later was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m.</p>

<h2>Synopsis[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mountaintop&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Synopsis">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mountaintop&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The Mountaintop begins with Martin Luther King Jr. returning to the Lorraine Motel after his sermon, I've Been To The Mountaintop. King sends his friend to fetch him cigarettes, ultimately leaving him alone in Room 306 as a storm rages outside. Ordering room service, King comes into contact with Camae (Carrie Mae), the mysterious and beautiful maid who strikes King's attention immediately. The beginning interactions between the two are filled with flirtation and humor but through the night it slowly progresses to something much deeper. King and Camae begin to discuss the hopes and fears that Martin Luther King Jr. has been feeling, forming a connection and understanding between the two. The conversation focuses on the fight for civil rights and reaches the climax when Camae reveals her true intentions for walking into King's motel room that night.</p>
<p>Camae is an angel sent by God to collect King and bring him to heaven; Camae reveals that King will die tomorrow, April 4, by being assassinated. Forced to confront his fears, King tries to bargain and plead with Camae to give him more time, explaining that he needs to continue his work in the civil rights movement before he can go. Camae, with a great sense of sadness, reasons with King, describing how the "baton", a reference of the ever passing responsibility for the civil rights cause, will continue to be passed on even when he is gone. King still denying his future forces Camae to call God with the hopes that he can convince God to give him more time. However, the call ends with King understanding his fate is set in stone and that his death is arriving shortly. With this realization King makes one last wish, to see his legacy and how it will affect the future to come. In the last minutes, King has a vision filled with significant names that grab the "baton" to continue the fight for civil rights, events that further the cause, as well as accomplishments that have been made in the future. Martin Luther King Jr. finishes his vision with a monologue to motivate people to continue the fight for civil rights in the hope that one day we will reach the Promised Land on Earth, ending the play with him handing of the baton to whoever is willing to take it next.</p>

<h3>Symbolism[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mountaintop&action=edit&section=4" title="Edit section: Symbolism">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The Mountaintop is full of symbols that a multitude of readers skip over thinking they are "extra details" included in the play. These symbols help further develop the themes throughout the play, as well as give a hidden meaning to some of the most simplistic things. Katori Hall explains that she has created the image of Martin Luther King Jr. with "warts and all".<ref target="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</ref> This can be seen in her description of his "smelly feet", socks with holes in them, a sense of being vain as he debated whether he should shave his mustache or not, and his flirtatiousness and infidelities with other women despite being married. This representation of King is made to challenge readers to see Martin Luther King Jr. as more of an average human instead of placing him on top of a pedestal. Immediately, Hall received backlash from readers and the black community, but she did not back down stating, "A warts-and-all portrayal of Dr. King is important because there's this extraordinary human being who is actually quite ordinary. I feel as though by portraying him with his flaws and foibles, we, too, can see—as human beings who have these flaws—that we, too, can be Kings; we, too, can carry on that baton that he has passed down to us."<ref target="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</ref></p>

<h3>Inspiration for The Mountaintop[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Mountaintop&action=edit&section=6" title="Edit section: Inspiration for The Mountaintop">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Katori Hall's mother was still a young girl when Martin Luther King Jr. arrived in Memphis, Tennessee to speak out on the behalf of the sanitation workers. Hall's mother was influenced by the works of King and wanted to see his speech at <ref target="/wiki/Mason_Temple" title="Mason Temple">Mason Temple</ref> in 1968, however was refused the chance by her mother; Katori Hall's grandmother. The reasoning behind why Hall's mother could not go to see Martin Luther King give one of his last speeches was explained as such, "Big Mama ... was like, 'You know they're gon' bomb that church, girl. You know they're gon' bomb that church, so you need to sit your butt down and you ain't going to that church.' "<ref target="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</ref> Hall's mother stated it was the biggest regret of her life as the following day King was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel. With this knowledge Hall created the idea of The Mountaintop, and named the maid which King discusses his life with after her mother, Carrie Mae. Katori Hall stated, "I wanted to put both of them in the same room and give my mother that opportunity that she didn't have in 1968." <ref target="#cite_note-:0-2">[2]</ref></p>
