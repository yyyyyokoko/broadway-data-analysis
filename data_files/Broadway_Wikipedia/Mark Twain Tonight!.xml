<h2>Background[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Mark_Twain_Tonight!&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Background">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>The recitation's genesis was a show that Holbrook performed with his then-wife Ruby in which she would interview him portraying famous people in history, including Twain.<ref target="#cite_note-Hal_Holbrook_on_PBS.org-2">[2]</ref> Holbrook revised the concept into a one-man show in the 1950s, first performing it at the <ref target="/wiki/Lock_Haven_University_of_Pennsylvania" title="Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania">Lock Haven State Teachers College</ref> in Pennsylvania in 1954.<ref target="#cite_note-Hal_Holbrook_on_PBS.org-2">[2]</ref> He made his first <ref target="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</ref> appearance as Twain in the <ref target="/wiki/Off-Broadway" title="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</ref> engagement in 1959 and premiered it on <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Broadway_theatres" title="Broadway theatres">Broadway</ref> in 1966. Holbrook's performance was first noticed by New York <ref target="/wiki/Theatrical_producer" title="Theatrical producer">producer</ref> <ref target="/wiki/John_Lotas" title="John Lotas">John Lotas</ref> at The <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lambs_Club" title="Lambs Club">Lambs Club</ref> in <ref target="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</ref>. Lotas presented the show at the Forty-First Street Theatre, where it ran for 174 performances. He won a <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Performance_by_a_Leading_Actor_in_a_Play" title="Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play">Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play</ref> for that appearance and an <ref target="/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</ref> nomination for the 1967 television broadcast (which was produced by <ref target="/wiki/David_Susskind" title="David Susskind">David Susskind</ref>) on <ref target="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</ref>.</p>
<p>The last performance on <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Broadway_theatres" title="Broadway theatres">Broadway</ref> was in 2006. Holbrook was known to alternate the material that he performed. The original program from the 1959 Off-Broadway engagement included the note, "While Mr. Twain’s selections will come from the list below, we have been unable to pin him down as to which of them he will do. He claims this would cripple his inspiration. However, he has generously conceded to a printed program for those who are in distress and wish to fan themselves."<ref target="#cite_note-3">[3]</ref> This appeared on programs for the show until Holbrook abruptly announced his retirement from the show in September 2017.<ref target="#cite_note-holbrookretires-4">[4]</ref></p>
<p>At the time of his retirement, Holbrook noted that he had been performing under the name "Mark Twain" 13 years longer than its originator: Samuel Clemens had adopted the <ref target="/wiki/Pseudonym" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</ref> at age 24 and died at the age of 74.</p>

<h2>The performance[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=Mark_Twain_Tonight!&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: The performance">edit</ref>]</h2>
<ref class="image" href="/wiki/File:Hal_Holbrook_as_Mark_Twain.jpg"></ref> <ref class="internal" href="/wiki/File:Hal_Holbrook_as_Mark_Twain.jpg" title="Enlarge"></ref>Holbrook performing as Twain at the <ref target="/wiki/University_of_Houston" title="University of Houston">University of Houston</ref>
<p>In an interview with <ref target="/wiki/William_Goldman" title="William Goldman">William Goldman</ref>, Holbrook explained how he structured the show. "Who wants to see an evening about a literary figure? I knew that in the first act I had to overcome that natural reluctance, so my biggest desire was to make them laugh their asses off at the start, so they'd go out at intermission and say, 'Hey, this guy's funny.' The second act became the social-comment act. I'd start with some funny material to get them again (but not too much of it, or they'd never stop laughing and take the show right away from you). In the last act I gave them the Twain they'd been expecting all along: warm, whimsical, memories of childhood."<ref target="#cite_note-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>Holbrook adapted to concerns that presenting Mark Twain as on an 1890s lecture circuit would use racial slurs acceptable in that era, but unacceptable to modern audiences. Challenging the critics, Holbrook often chose to read a passage from "Huckleberry Finn" where the orphaned, pipe-smoking, uneducated youngster, Huck, faces a poignant moral dilemma. Holbrook altered the narration to use the dialectally milder "Nigra" as the young boy wrestles with his conscience over following the law or his heart concerning "the widow's Nigra, Jim," a runaway slave. Audiences have embraced this presentation as the boy ultimately rejects the legal, societal and even religious ramifications in favor of helping the runaway on his quest for freedom. It is one of the more somber segments of a usually humorous presentation, which Holbrook has felt important to continue in the spirit of Twain's own message.[<ref target="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</ref>]</p>
