<h2>Plot[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Boy_from_Oz&action=edit&section=1" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</ref>]</h2>
<h3>Act I[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Boy_from_Oz&action=edit&section=2" title="Edit section: Act I">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>The musical begins with Australian performer Peter Allen recalling his life story, coming to terms with who he was ("The Lives of Me"). Afterwards, we go back to Allen's childhood in Tenterfield, Australia, where a young boy named Peter Woolnough is performing in local bars for money ("When I Get My Name in Lights"). Peter grows up and joins with Chris Bell to become the Allen Brothers, and they perform in Australian Bandstand ("Love Crazy"). After great success in Australia, the Allen Brothers perform in a Hong Kong Hilton hotel to Chinese businessmen. One evening, another person is watching them from the bar: the legendary Judy Garland. Peter convinces Judy to perform with them ("All I Wanted Was the Dream"), and Judy takes Peter to be the opening act in her concert in New York ("Only an Older Woman").</p>
<p>While in New York, Peter is introduced to Judy's daughter, <ref target="/wiki/Liza_Minnelli" title="Liza Minnelli">Liza</ref>, and they fall in love ("Best That You Can Do"). There are rumors of Peter's homosexuality, and Judy warns Liza of this ("Don't Wish Too Hard"). Liza gives no attention to her warning and marries Peter ("Come Save Me"). </p>
<p>Peter makes some mistakes, and at one of his all night parties Liza walks in on him ("Continental American"), further fueling her suspicions that he is gay. Liza is working hard to get her career going ("She Loves to Hear the Music"), in contrast to Peter's excessive lifestyle. Judy dies, and Peter honors her ("Quiet Please, There's a Lady on Stage"). Liza's world comes crashing down as a result of her mother's death.</p>
<p>Liza confronts Peter on his alleged homosexuality, and their marriage ends ("I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love"). Peter returns to Australia but realizes that he is not who people thought he was ("Not the Boy Next Door").</p>

<h3>Act II[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Boy_from_Oz&action=edit&section=3" title="Edit section: Act II">edit</ref>]</h3>
<p>Back in the US, Peter has gone solo and comes to terms with his bisexuality ("<ref target="/wiki/Bi-Coastal" title="Bi-Coastal">Bi-Coastal</ref>"). He meets the hardworking fashion model Gregory Connell. Greg does not want to be a part of Peter's life in show business, but he falls in love with Peter ("If You Were Wondering"). They soon get discovered by music producer <ref target="/wiki/Dee_Anthony" title="Dee Anthony">Dee Anthony</ref>, and he gets them a gig at the <ref target="/wiki/Copacabana_(nightclub)" title="Copacabana (nightclub)">Copacabana</ref> in New York ("Sure Thing Baby"). Peter's career takes off, and he wins an Oscar for <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arthur%27s_Theme" title="Arthur's Theme">Arthur's Theme</ref>, in addition to recording songs that were covered by artists <ref target="/wiki/Olivia_Newton-John" title="Olivia Newton-John">Olivia Newton-John</ref> and <ref target="/wiki/Frank_Sinatra" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</ref>. Peter gives his best performance in the <ref target="/wiki/Radio_City_Music_Hall" title="Radio City Music Hall">Radio City Music Hall</ref> with <ref target="/wiki/The_Rockettes" title="The Rockettes">The Rockettes</ref> ("<ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Everything_Old_is_New_Again" title="Everything Old is New Again">Everything Old is New Again</ref>"), and is surprised to know his mother is also in love.</p>
<p>Greg becomes stricken with <ref class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/AIDS" title="AIDS">AIDS</ref>, and even though Peter tries to help him carry on, he succumbs to his illness ("Love Don't Need a Reason"). Peter also becomes sick with AIDS, but Greg's spirit urges him to carry on ("<ref target="/wiki/I_Honestly_Love_You" title="I Honestly Love You">I Honestly Love You</ref>"). Liza offers her support to Peter, and they both realize they had successful lives and careers without each other ("You and Me").</p>
<p>Peter returns to Australia for a triumphant performance ("I Still Call Australia Home") and tries to tell his mother about his illness, but he can't find a way to tell her ("Don't Cry Out Loud").</p>
<p>Peter succumbs to his disease, and he reflects on his life realizing he has no regrets as he passes away ("Once Before I Go"), but not before going out in style with a farewell performance ("I Go to Rio").<ref target="#cite_note-1">[1]</ref></p>

<h2>Reception[<ref target="/w/index.php?title=The_Boy_from_Oz&action=edit&section=13" title="Edit section: Reception">edit</ref>]</h2>
<p>In his review of the Broadway production for The New York Times, <ref target="/wiki/Ben_Brantley" title="Ben Brantley">Ben Brantley</ref> wrote, "His limbs twirling like the blades of a windmill, Mr. Jackman channels the energy that was Allen with a rejuvenating life force all his own. And you don’t feel — as you so often do with such interpretations — that your memories of the prototype have been blurred. This is a performance that, against the odds, holds on to its integrity." However Brantley went on to write: "...this musical settles for a staleness and a hollowness that even Mr. Jackman's blazing presence can't disguise."<ref target="#cite_note-NYTReview-5">[5]</ref></p>
<p>In his review for <ref target="/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</ref> of the Broadway production, <ref target="/wiki/Charles_Isherwood" title="Charles Isherwood">Charles Isherwood</ref> praised Jackman but panned the show: "Jackman is giving a vital and engaging performance in this pitifully flimsy musical almost in spite of the material he’s been handed. It’s a sad waste of an exciting talent."<ref target="#cite_note-12">[12]</ref></p>
<p>David Rooney, writing in Variety about the Australian arena tour, said, "When he first performed the role on Broadway in 2003, Hugh Jackman’s charisma, vitality and breezy confidence onstage far outshone the narrative or emotional scope of the by-the-numbers biomusical of singer-songwriter Peter Allen. The scales have been tipped even further toward the performer in this pumped-up reconfiguration of the show, playing state capitals in venues of 10,000 seats or more. It’s as much a concert platform for a returning local boy made good in Hollywood as it is a life story of Peter Allen. And that’s no bad thing."<ref target="#cite_note-13">[13]</ref></p>
